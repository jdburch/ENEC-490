%set up your excel file to be two columns only-- dates and prices. Then delete the months for 1986 and 2016 since there are missing data. 

data = xlsread('ENEC490DATAS2.xls') %used this to try to find the data when I placed it into the mat lab folder to import 

%just take the price data
prices = data(:,1); 


years = length(prices)/12;

%convert to a matrix
matrix = zeros(years,12);

for i=1:years
  for j = 1:12
  
  matrix(i,j) = prices((i-1)*12+j);
  
  end
end

for i=1:12
monthly_averages(i) = mean(matrix(:,i));
end

xlswrite("monthly_average_price.xlsx",monthly_averages);

data = xlsread('ENEC490DATAedited.xls')
price = data(:,1);
year = length(price)/12;
matrix = zeroes(year,12);
for i= 1:year
    for j=1:12
        matrix(i,j)=price((i-1)*12+j))
    end
end
for i=1:12
    monthly_averages(i) = mean(matrix(:,i));
end
xlswrite('monthly_average_price.xlsx',monthly_averages); %what my code looks like now, the same as yours and it works, Thanks!
